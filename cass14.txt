CASS 14.1 General application
Who?
CASS 14.1.1
01/01/2021
R
This chapter only applies to a TP firm that has not failed.
What?
CASS 14.1.2
01/01/2021
R
Unless otherwise stated, the rules in CASS 14 apply:
(1) in relation to:
(a) a TP firm’s activities to which CASS 7 applies as a result of GEN 2.2.26R, but subject to CASS 14.1.3R; and
(b) a TP firm’s activities to which CASS 5 or CASS 6 applies as a result of GEN 2.2.26R; and
(2) where those activities are carried on in reliance on the TP firm’s temporary permission.
CASS 14.1.3
01/01/2021
R
CASS 14 does not apply in relation to a TP firm’s activities to which CASS 7 applies if, during the period for which it is has a temporary permission, the TP firm does not hold any client money for the purposes of the rules in CASS 7 that apply as a result of GEN 2.2.26R.
CASS 14.1.4
01/01/2021
G
CASS 14.1.3R may, for example, be relevant to a TP firm that can apply the exclusion from the definition of client money at CASS 7.10.16R(1) (credit institutions) or at CASS 7.11.1R(4) (title transfer collateral arrangements) throughout the period.
CASS 14.1.5
01/01/2021
G
(1) CASS 14 does not apply in relation to a TP firm’s activities which are carried on other than in reliance on its temporary permission. It only applies in relation to the part of its Part 4A permission that the TP firm is treated as having under regulation 8, 11, 28 or 34 of the EU Exit Passport Regulations.
(2) For example, where a TP firm had Part 4A permission immediately before IP completion day to act as trustee or depositary of an AIF or to act as trustee or depositary of a UCITS, and continues to hold that permission, the rules applying to activities under that part of its Part 4A permission are not affected by its temporary permission because of GEN 2.2.26R(1) (see also the guidance at GEN 2.2.37G(3)). In relation to those activities, it should continue to comply with the applicable rules in CASS. It may also consider making the election at CASS 14.3.6R in relation to its activities that are carried on in reliance on the TP firm’s temporary permission.
Where?
CASS 14.1.6
01/01/2021
R
The rules in CASS 14 apply in relation to a TP firm’s activities described at CASS 14.1.2R wherever they are carried on.
CASS 14.1.7
01/01/2021
G
CASS 14.1.6R means that the rules in CASS 14 apply both to activities carried on from a UK branch and activities carried on other than from a UK branch into the UK.
CASS 14.2 Temporary permission CASS firm classification
CASS 14.2.1
01/01/2021
R
(1) Subject to paragraphs (2) to (5), this section applies only to a TP firm to which either or both of CASS 6 and CASS 7 apply as a result of GEN 2.2.26R.
(2) In relation to a TP firm to which both CASS 5 and CASS 7 (Client money rules) apply as a result of GEN 2.2.26R, this section does not apply in relation to client money that the TP firm holds in accordance with CASS 5 as a result of GEN 2.2.26R.

(b) it projects that either or both will apply to it as a result of GEN 2.2.26R in the current calendar year.
(4) The rules in this section do not apply to a TP firm to which, as a result of GEN 2.2.26R, only CASS 6 applies, applied or is projected to apply, merely because it is, was, or is projected to be a firm which arranges safeguarding and administration of assets.
(5) The rules in this section do not apply to a TP firm that has notified the FCA of an election made under CASS 14.3.6R.

CASS 14.2.3
01/01/2021

CASS 14.2.4
01/01/2021
R
(1) A TP firm must once every year, and by the time it is required to make a notification in accordance with CASS 14.2.9R, determine whether it is a CASS large TP firm, CASS medium TP firm or a CASS small TP firm according to the amount of client money or safe custody assets which it holds, using the limits set out in the table in CASS 14.2.8R.
(2) For the purpose of determining its ‘CASS firm type’ in accordance with CASS 14.2.8R, a TP firm must:
(a) if it currently holds client money or safe custody assets, calculate the higher of the highest total amount of client money and the highest total value of safe custody assets held during the previous calendar year ending on 31 December, and use that figure to determine its ‘CASS firm type’;
(b) if it did not hold client money or safe custody assets in the previous calendar year but projects that it will do so in the current calendar year, calculate the higher of the highest total amount of client money and the highest total value of safe custody assets that it projects that it will hold during that year, and use that figure to determine its ‘CASS firm type’; but
(c) in either case, exclude from its calculation any client money held in accordance with CASS 5.
CASS 14.2.5
01/01/2021
G
For the purposes of CASS 14.2.4R a TP firm should only include client money and safe custody assets that it holds (or is projected to hold) in relation to the TP firm’s activities which are carried on (or projected to be carried on) in reliance of the firm’s temporary permission.

R
For the purpose of calculating the value of the total amounts of client money and safe custody assets that it holds on any given day during a calendar year a TP firm must:
(1) in complying with CASS 14.2.4R(2)(a), base its calculation on the reconciliation performed in accordance with CASS 7.15.20R during the previous year;
(2) in relation to client money or safe custody assets denominated in a currency other than sterling, translate the value of that money or those safe custody assets into sterling at the previous day’s closing spot exchange rate; and
(3) in relation to safe custody assets only, calculate their total value using the previous day’s closing mark to market valuation, or if in relation to a particular safe custody asset none is available, the most recent available valuation.
CASS 14.2.7
01/01/2021
R
(1) Notwithstanding CASS 14.2.4R, provided that the conditions in (2) are satisfied a TP firm may elect to be treated:
(a) as a CASS medium TP firm, in the case of a TP firm that is classed by the application of the limits in CASS 14.2.8R as a CASS small TP firm; and

CASS 14.4.3
01/01/2021
R
(1) If the TP firm did not have a temporary permission during the entire period covered by an auditor’s report, that auditor’s report is excluded from the requirement under CASS 14.4.2R.
(2) Where the auditor’s report required under CASS 14.4.2R is not in English, the TP firm must ensure that the FCA receives both the auditor’s report and an English translation of it.

R
(1) A TP firm must ensure that any auditor’s report and English translation which are required to be provided to the FCA under this section are sent by email.

CASS 14.5 Client information
CASS 14.5.1
01/01/2021
R
A TP firm must provide any client in respect of which it carries on the activities specified in CASS 14.1.2R with the following information (the “TP Firm CASS Disclosure”) in English and in a durable medium:
(1) any non-UK jurisdiction under which the TP firm’s failure may be administered; and
(2) unless such an outcome is not possible under the law of that jurisdiction as it applies on IP completion day, a statement that makes clear the possibility that any client money or safe custody assets belonging to that client will, as a result of the law of that jurisdiction, be treated differently to money or assets belonging to other customers of the TP firm in the event of the TP firm’s failure.
CASS 14.5.2
01/01/2021
R
(1) A firm must ensure that the “TP Firm CASS Disclosure” is not obscured by or disguised within other information.
(2) Where a firm provides the “TP Firm CASS Disclosure” amidst or alongside other information, it must ensure that it uses a font size for the ‘TP Firm CASS Disclosure’ that is at least equal to the predominant font size used throughout the information provided, as well as a layout that ensures the “TP Firm CASS Disclosure” is prominent.
CASS 14.5.3
01/01/2021
G
(1) To comply with CASS 14.5.1R(1) it is sufficient to name the jurisdiction. For example, this may be the name of the TP firm’s Home State, or an administrative region within it.
(2) In order to comply with CASS 14.5.1R(2), a TP firm should carefully consider the applicable law and insolvency rules in question as at IP completion day when deciding whether or not a statement is required to be given under that provision. For example, it could obtain a legal opinion on whether the law differentiates between the treatment of different classes of clients. If, following such careful consideration, the firm cannot rule out the possibility of different treatment, then it should make the statement under CASS 14.5.1R(2).
CASS 14.5.4
01/01/2021
R
The “TP Firm CASS Disclosure” under CASS 14.5.1R is not required where a firm complies with those requirements of CASS 5, CASS 6 or CASS 7 that are applied under GEN 2.2.26R without needing to safeguard client money or safe custody assets.
CASS 14.5.5
01/01/2021
G
Situations falling under CASS 14.5.4R include where, for example, the TP firm relies on:
(1) CASS 5.1.5R(1)(b) or (2);
(2) CASS 7.10.6R; or
(3) GEN 2.2.26R(3) or (4) and takes the approach set out in article 10.6.a, 10.6.b or 10.6.d of IDD.
CASS 14.5.6
01/01/2021
R
A TP firm must provide the “TP Firm CASS Disclosure” under CASS 14.5.1R to a client:
(1) where it safeguards client money or safe custody assets for the client on IP completion day, on that date (unless it has taken steps before that date which would have complied with the requirements under CASS 14.5.1R and CASS 14.5.2R); or
(2) otherwise, in good time before it safeguards client money or custody assets for the client.
CASS 14.6 Tied agents and appointed representatives of TP firms
CASS 14.6.1
01/01/2021
G
(1) CASS does not apply directly to a TP firm’s appointed representative or tied agent.
(2) A TP firm will be responsible for the acts and omissions of its appointed representatives and tied agents in carrying on business for which the TP firm has accepted responsibility.
(3) In determining whether a TP firm has complied with any provision of CASS, anything done or omitted by a TP firm's appointed representative or tied agent (when acting as such) will be treated as having been done or omitted by the TP firm.
(4) CASS 14.6.2R further restricts the possibility of appointed representatives and tied agents of TP firms from receiving or holding client money and safe custody assets. But that rule does not apply in relation to the business of an appointed representative or tied agent of a TP firm in respect of which CASS 5 would apply to the TP firm as a result of GEN 2.2.26R.
CASS 14.6.2
01/01/2021
R
A TP firm must not permit an appointed representative or tied agent to receive or hold client money or safe custody assets in the course of or in connection with any of their business in respect of which CASS 6 or CASS 7 would apply to the TP firm as a result of GEN 2.2.26R.

CASS 14 Annex 2G Guidance notes for the TPCAR
CASS 14 Annex 2G
01/01/2021
G
1. This annex contains guidance on the TPCAR and is therefore only relevant to a firm that is subject to CASS 14.3.
2. Italicised terms in the TPCAR have the same meaning as in the Glossary.
3. A firm is reminded of its obligation to determine their “CASS firm type” categorisation in accordance with CASS 14.2.8R.
4. A firm should complete Part 1 and either Part 2 or Part 3, depending on whether it is reporting on investment services and activities or insurance distribution activities. See also the guidance at CASS 14.3.5G for firms that carry on both sorts of activities under their temporary permission.
5. For the purposes of the TPCAR, the FCA does not prescribe any particular methodology or frequency for valuing safe custody assets.
6. Guide for completing individual questions in the TPCAR:
PART 1 - TO BE COMPLETED BY ALL TP FIRMS
Section 1.1 - Scope of this return
1.1.1
What is the reporting period start date for this return?
1.1.2
What is the reporting period end date for this return?
The reporting period is a calendar period for which the TPCAR is required to be completed in accordance with CASS 14.3.1R, including the first day and the last day of the relevant period applicable to the firm. The first reporting period starts from 1 January 2021.
For example:
• For a firm conducting investment services or activities under their temporary permission which is subject to monthly reporting under CASS 14.3.3R, the first reporting period will be 1 January 2021 to 31 January 2021, regardless of whether or not any day in January is a business day.
• For a firm conducting insurance distribution activities under their temporary permission which is subject to half-yearly reporting under CASS 14.3.3R and has an accounting reference date of 31 March, the first reporting period will be 1 January 2021 to 31 March 2021, regardless of whether or not any day in this period is a business day. The next reporting period for such a firm will be 1 April 2021 to 30 September 2021.
1.1.3
Does this return report on:
- investment services and activities, to which CASS 6 or CASS 7 apply as a result of GEN 2.2.26R; or
- insurance distribution activities, to which CASS 5 applies as a result of GEN 2.2.26R?
A firm should identify the relevant activity in the course of which it holds client money or safe custody assets under its temporary permission and answer either “investment services or activities” or “insurance distribution activities”.
If a firm is conducting both activities in the course of which it holds client money or safe custody assets under its temporary permission, then it will need to complete a separate TPCAR for each activity.
Section 1.2 - Location of activities
1.2.1
Did the firm conduct the activities to which this return relates from an establishment in the UK?
A firm should answer either “Yes” or “No”. For example, a firm should answer “Yes” if, during the reporting period, it conducted the above activities from a branch in the UK.
Section 1.3 - Compliance
1.3.1
During the reporting period, did the firm have any breaches of its obligations under CASS 14?
A firm should answer either “Yes” or “No”.
1.3.2
During the reporting period, did the firm obtain an external auditor’s report on the adequacy of the firm's arrangements under its client assets obligations?
A firm should answer either “Yes” or “No”.
Section 1.4 - Solvency
1.4.1
During the reporting period, were there any issues with the firm's solvency?
A firm should answer either “Yes” or “No”.
Section 1.5 - Other issues
1.5.1
During the reporting period, were there any other issues with the firm in relation to its obligations under CASS which applied as a result of GEN 2.2.26R? If so, please provide a brief description.
A firm should describe any issues not covered by the TPCAR that may be relevant in respect of holding client money or safe custody assets to which CASS applies as a result of GEN 2.2.26R during the reporting period.
