Application for retail clients, professional clients and eligible counterparties
CASS 1.2.8
01/07/2014
G
(1) CASS applies directly in respect of activities conducted with or for all categories of clients.
(2) [deleted]
(3) The insurance client money chapter does not generally distinguish between different categories of client. However, the term consumer is used for those to whom additional obligations are owed, rather than the term retail client. This is to be consistent with the client categories used in the Insurance: New Conduct of Business sourcebook.
(4) Each provision in the collateral rules, custody chapter, the client money chapter and CASS 9 (Information to clients) makes it clear whether it applies to activities carried on for retail clients, professional clients or both.
(4A) There is no further modification of the rules in the chapters referred to in (4) for activities carried on for eligible counterparties. Such clients are treated in the same way as other professional clients for the purposes of these rules.
(5) The debt management client money chapter generally applies in respect of relevant dealings with the client category known as customers. In general, the client categories of retail clients, professional clients, as well as eligible counterparties, have no relevance to credit-related regulated activities, including debt management activities.
Application for affiliates
CASS 1.2.9A
01/06/2015
G
(1) The fact that a firm's client is an affiliated company for MiFID business does not affect the operation of CASS to the firm in relation to that client.
(2) For business that is not MiFID business, the operation of the custody chapter or the client money chapter may differ if a firm's client is an affiliated company and depending on certain other conditions (see, for example, CASS 6.1.10B R and CASS 7.10.26 R).
Investments and money held under different regimes
CASS 1.2.11
01/06/2015
R
(1) A firm must not keep money in respect of which any one of the following chapters applies in the same client bank account or client transaction account as money in respect of which another of the following chapters applies:
(a) the client money chapter;
(b) the insurance client money chapter;
(c) the debt management client money chapter.
(2) In accordance with CASS 7.10.36 R, a firm which is subject to the client money chapter and holds money both (i) in its capacity as a trustee firm and (ii) other than in its capacity as a trustee firm must not keep money held in its capacity as a trustee firm in the same client bank account or client transaction account as money held other than in its capacity as a trustee firm.
(3) To the extent that the restriction under (1) or (2) applies to a firm, the client bank accounts and client transaction accounts that a firm holds in respect of different chapters or in its different capacities (as the case may be) must be separately designated.
CASS 1.2.12
01/11/2007
G
The purpose of the rules regarding the segregation of investments and money held under different regimes is to reduce the risk of confusion between assets held under different regimes either on an on-going basis or on the failure of a firm or a third party holding those assets.
CASS 1.2.13
01/06/2015
G
A firm may, where permitted by the relevant rules opt to hold under a single chapter money that would otherwise be held under different chapters (see CASS 7.10.3 R and CASS 7.10.30 R). However, making such an election does not remove the requirement under CASS 1.2.11R (1).

Appointed representatives and tied agents
CASS 1.4.5
01/11/2007
G
(1) Although CASS does not apply directly to a firm's appointed representatives, a firm will always be responsible for the acts and omissions of its appointed representatives in carrying on business for which the firm has accepted responsibility (section 39(3) of the Act). In determining whether a firm has complied with any provision of CASS, anything done or omitted by a firm's appointed representative (when acting as such) will be treated as having been done or omitted by the firm (section 39(4) of the Act). Equally, CASS does not apply directly to tied agents. A MiFID investment firm will be fully and unconditionally responsible for the acts and omission of the tied agents that it appoints.
(2) Firms should also refer to SUP 12 (Appointed representatives), which sets out requirements which apply to firms using appointed representatives and tied agents.
